                                        <h3 class="major">How we use your personal data</h3>
                                        <p>We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Data in the following circumstances:</p>
                                        <p>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</p>
                                        <p>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</p>
                                        <p>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</p>
                                        <p>Where we need to collect Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>
                                        <p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
                                        <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>

										<p>4. If buyer cancels his/her order after one minute of placing it, CheerOn shall have a right to collect a penalty of 100% of the order amount for breach of contract terms as a compensation for the damages suffered by CheerOn, with a right to either not to refund the order value in case buyer’s order is prepaid or recover from the buyer’s subsequent order in case his/her order is postpaid, to compensate the merchants and PDPs.</p>

                                        <p>1. Buyer may be entitled to a refund for prepaid orders. CheerOn retains the right to retain the penalty payable by the buyer from the amount refundable to him/her.

Buyer may be entitled to a refund up to 100% of the order value if product detail page fails to deliver the order due to a cause attributable to either product detail page or CheerOn. However, such refunds will be assessed on a case-to-case basis by CheerOn.</p>

                                        <p>3. Our decision on refunds shall be final and binding.</p>

                                        <p>4. All refund amounts shall be credited to buyer’s account as may be stipulated as per the payment mechanism of buyer’s choice.</p>

                                        <p>5. In case of payment at the time of delivery, buyer will not be required to pay for:
                                        - Orders where packaging is either tampered or damaged at the time of delivery;
                                        - Wrong order being delivered; or
                                        - Items missing from buyer’s order at the time of delivery. Provided the same is communicated to CheerOn customer care through the platform before the order is marked delivered.</p>
